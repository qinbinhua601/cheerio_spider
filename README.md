## Purpose

For simply grabbing data from a specific web site by *superagent*
And enjoy the simplicity of the *cheerio*'s jquery selector syntac to select the specific nodes!

Of course , you should install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/download/) first.

## Install cheerio & superagent

sudo npm install cheerio superagent -save-dev

## Try running

Run node index.js @ your project root directory.e.g. */cheerio_spider/*  
You'll see the result printed as followed.

[qlog] : server started on port : 8888


## Then

Open your browser and type in http://localhost:8888.
After a while, you'll be able to see the lasttest 3 days' videos links from www.zhibo8.cc. :)
